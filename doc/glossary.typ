- *RISC* - Reduced Instruction Set Computing - RISC is a processor architecture that uses a simple and limited instruction set with the goal of achieving higher efficiency and faster execution of instructions. Each instruction is typically executed within a single processor cycle.
- *CISC* - Complex Instruction Set Computing - CISC is a processor architecture that uses more complex instruction sets. A single instruction can perform multiple operations, which may reduce the number of instructions but increase the complexity and number of cycles required to execute one instruction.
- *MCU* - MicroControler Unit - A small, integrated circuit designed to perform specific tasks such as controlling embedded systems, typically combining a processor, memory, and peripherals in one package.
- *Simulator* - A simulator is a program or device that mimics the behavior of another system, such as a processor. In the case of processor simulation, the simulator replicates the execution of instructions and the interaction with hardware without the need for a physical processor.
- *Emulator* - An emulator is a device or software that imitates the functionality of another device, including its behavior and environment, on a different system. Emulators are often used to run programs designed for another platform.
- *Instruction Set* - The set of all instructions that a processor can execute.
- *Processor Cycle* - The time it takes for a processor to execute one instruction or part of an instruction.
- *Register* - A small, fast memory unit within the processor that is used to temporarily store data during instruction execution.
- *Memory*: The space where programs and data that the processor works with are stored.
- *Cache* - A fast memory located between the processor and main memory, which accelerates access to frequently used data.
